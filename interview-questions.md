# ASSESSMENT 3: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is JSX? What is one syntax difference between HTML and JSX?

Your answer: HTML is a scripting language for making static webpages. JSX allows for JS code to be put into an HTML type document.

Researched answer: JSX is pretty cool because it lets you mix in expressions and functions right into your code, whereas with regular HTML, you can only work with plain static text.

2. What is yarn? What file(s) are modified when you run the command yarn in your terminal?

Your answer: I think its a package manager of some sort that allows you to modify files in react.

Researched answer: Yarn serves as a tool for managing JavaScript packages and is frequently employed in React development. It was developed as a substitute for NPM, the initial JavaScript package manager, mainly due to its reputation for being faster, more secure, and more dependable.

3. What is the difference between state values and props in React?

Your answer: State values hold information and props use state values to pass information via components.

Researched answer: Props play a role in sending information from a parent component to a child component, serving as a way to communicate data. State, on the other hand, is employed to handle data within a single component. It's important to note that props are unchangeable and cannot be altered within a component, whereas state is changeable and can be updated through the use of the setState function.

4. STRETCH: Which is the difference between a div tag and a span tag?

Researched answer: Span and div are both fundamental HTML elements used to group and organize content on a web page. However, they have distinct purposes. The div element is employed for block-level structuring and styling of page elements, allowing you to create larger sections or containers. In contrast, the span element is used for inline organization and styling, making it suitable for smaller, inline portions of content.

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

1. DOM: The DOM, or Document Object Model, is like a hierarchical map that depicts the layout of a web application's user interface. Every part of the HTML content on a webpage is transformed into a node within this tree structure. By using JavaScript, you can interact with and alter these nodes, allowing you to change their appearance, properties, and more. In essence, the DOM empowers JavaScript to conveniently manipulate and work with the contents of a web page.

2. Object-oriented programming: Object-oriented programming (OOP) serves as a foundational programming approach used in numerous programming languages like Java and C++. In this article, we will give you a summary of the core principles of OOP. We will delve into three primary ideas: classes and instances, inheritance, and encapsulation.

3. Ruby: Ruby is a versatile programming language that can be applied to a wide range of tasks. It is well-suited for creating desktop applications, static websites, data processing services, and various automation tools. Ruby finds application in web servers, DevOps tasks, as well as web scraping and crawling, making it a valuable tool for multiple domains and purposes.
